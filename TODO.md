## TODO
[ ] consider creating request and response classes that handle 404, 201, 200, etc.
[ ] consider base class with get/put/post/delete methods that can be overridden, or better yet, create a "Connection" class
    which would be useful for class-level operations as well.  Then objects would have a @conn instance variable.
